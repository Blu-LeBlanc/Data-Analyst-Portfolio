# Blu LeBlanc || Data-Analyst-Portfolio
## About
Hello, my name is Blu. I have a strong analytical, mathematical background from my time in Physics, and I am currently taking courses towards a Masters in Data Science. I have developed a strong foundation in problem-solving, statistics, data organization, and critical thinking from my time as a physics major. I can't wait to bring my unique skillset to the field of data.

During my studies, I gained familiarity with proper experimentation, spreadsheet work, data visualizations, and identifying patterns. Many physics labs involved working in groups and collaborating to prove the theory we learned in class. Alongside my physics classes, I chose Data Science as a 2nd discipline and took courses on the foundations of programming, python, data science, and deep learning. From this experience, I gained familiarity with many python libraries, including using tensorflow for the creation of neural networks.

In my free time, I am looking for more ways to learn and gradually creating this portfolio to showcase my skills! After graduation, I took the Foundations of Data Analytics Coursera course to focus in on what I want to do after college. Now I am back to taking classes for the University of CU Boulder, while I polish up this portfolio.
